# Shoot 'em up!

An example "shoot 'em up" game made with [SDL3](https://www.libsdl.org/). Tools are:
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) for building and [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) for dependency management.

The repository comes with an example CMakeUserPresets, you might want to ignore that file in Git
going forward.
